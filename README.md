A tiny Rust-native shell completion solution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Releases Setup

1. [Create a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) with the name `completers` and push this generated project to it.
2. Enable Actions for the repository, and grant "Read and write permissions" to the workflow [here](https://github.com/PRO-2684/completers/settings/actions).
3. [Generate an API token on crates.io](https://crates.io/settings/tokens/new), with the following setup:

    - `Name`: `completers`
    - `Expiration`: `No expiration`
    - `Scopes`: `publish-new`, `publish-update`
    - `Crates`: `completers`

4. [Add a repository secret](https://github.com/PRO-2684/completers/settings/secrets/actions) named `CARGO_TOKEN` with the generated token as its value.
5. Consider removing this section and updating this README with your own project information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism

### Shell Completion

In Bash, you can designate a shell function as the completion provider using the `complete` command:

```bash
complete -F _my_completion_function my_command
```

Or you can designate a command using the `-C` option:

```bash
complete -C _my_completion_command my_command
```

Then, when the user types:

```bash
my_command <TAB>
```

Bash will call the completion provider with [relevant variables set](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html#:~:text=When%20the%20command%20or%20function%20is%20invoked%2C%20the%20COMP_LINE%2C%20COMP_POINT%2C%20COMP_KEY%2C%20and%20COMP_TYPE%20variables%20are%20assigned%20values%20as%20described%20above%20(see%20Bash%20Variables).%20If%20a%20shell%20function%20is%20being%20invoked%2C%20the%20COMP_WORDS%20and%20COMP_CWORD%20variables%20are%20also%20set), including:

- `COMP_WORDS`: An array of all the words in the command line, including the command itself. (If the completion provider is a shell function)
- `COMP_CWORD`: The index of the word in `COMP_WORDS` that is currently being completed. (If the completion provider is a shell function)
- `COMP_LINE`: The current command line.
- `COMP_POINT`: The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the current command.
- `COMP_TYPE`: Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of completion attempted that caused a completion function to be called.
- `COMP_KEY`: The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the current completion function.

If the completion provider is a shell function, it should set the `COMPREPLY` variable to an array of completion candidates. If the completion provider is a command, it should print the completion candidates to `stdout` line by line. Bash will then display the candidates to the user, or directly complete the command line if there is only one candidate.

### Integration with Rust

Consider the following code snippet:

```bash
_my_completion_function() {
    local IFS=$'\n'
    COMPREPLY=($(COMPLETE=1 my_command "$COMP_CWORD" "$COMP_LINE" "$COMP_POINT" "$COMP_TYPE" "$COMP_KEY" "${COMP_WORDS[@]}"))
}
complete -F _my_completion_function my_command
```

When the user types `my_command <TAB>`, Bash will call `_my_completion_function` with the relevant variables set. The function will then spread these values as command line arguments to `my_command` with `COMPLETE` environment variable set. `my_command`, on seeing the `COMPLETE` environment variable, will parse the arguments, determine completion candidates, and print them line by line to `stdout`. After receiving the output, `_my_completion_function` will then split the output line by line and set the completion candidates using `COMPREPLY` variable.

Note that the candidates are determined by `my_command` itself, not by a separate shell function. This allows for so-called Rust-native completion.
